With our innovative Balance Beams, you can now escape the daily rat race and head up there with the rest of them. No need to spend months in training and age is not a barrier with these handy foldaway planks of wood. Just head up to the roof of your building, unfold them to the length of the space you need to traverse and off you go.
Fully adjustable you will be able to travel a distance of up to 20 meters. The complete kit comes with a handy foldaway parachute for those extra windy days, and a neat little canvas bag for when they&apos;re not in use. Each plank is treated with a special non-slip coating to give extra strength and durability. We do recommend not wearing flip-flops or any other open-toe shoes while in use.
Be the adventurer you&apos;ve always wanted to be, but do it safely. T&amp;C&apos;s apply, third-party insurance recommended, use at the owners own risk.</td>

We would like to reduce the number of cars on the road even further, aiming one day for it to be none at all.
This is where we come in, our new &apos;Hitch A Lift&apos; harness is the future of commuting, improving life on earth, and boosting our own health and fitness in the process. Just strap on a buddy and use what God gave you to get yourselves to work.
One of you might be stronger than the other, but you can still take it in turns as our harness can be attached, and unattached, in seconds. There is a maximum recommended weight of 224 lbs so choose your hitch buddy wisely.
It is important that the weaker of the two get some practice in, you don&apos;t want to lose muscle power by not using those legs and upper body strength for long periods of time. Say goodbye to traffic jams and pollution, hitch up with a buddy today.</td>

If you&apos;re not a stretchy limb athlete we have the perfect solution for you. &apos;The Splash&apos;.
We supply you with a unique lightweight bucket, proven to hold a vast volume of liquid. Before you go to bed just fill the bucket with regular tap water and leave in a handy place for the morning. On waking grab that bucket and splash that water all over yourself, we find holding the bucket above your head works best.
Not only is &apos;The Splash&apos; refreshing and revitalizing it is a great time saver, as you will not need to take a separate shower before leaving home. We do strongly advise all of our customers to place plastic sheeting on the floors and bedding to avoid water damage, these are sold separately and in easy to cut sheets so they can be customized to fit your furnishings.
Don&apos;t be a Dopey Doris as you start your day, be a Bright Button with &apos;The Splash&apos;.</td>
