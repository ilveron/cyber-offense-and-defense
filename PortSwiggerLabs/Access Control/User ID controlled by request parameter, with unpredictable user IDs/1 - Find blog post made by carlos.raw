                    <h1>The history of swigging port</h1>
                    <p><span id=blog-author><a href='/blogs?userId=9f984e44-b5df-40a8-92ae-b03531623d51'>carlos</a></span> | 16 December 2024</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The &apos;discovery&apos; of port dates back to the late Seventeenth Century when British sailors stumbled upon the drink in Portugal and then stumbled even more slowly home with several more bottles. It has been said since then that Portugal is the mother of port and that Britain is the father, which loosely translates as Portugal does all the hard work of growing and birthing the product, while Britain shows up on evenings and weekends just for the fun stuff.</p>
                    <p>Portugal was the only nation willing to sell port to Britain, with France, Spain and Italy denying their service, a policy that seems highly likely to return in the months to come. Yet, back then, it was a less dignified drink, being guzzled in wartime and making fools of whoever drank it. Not the drink someone would refuse these days as it isn&apos;t accompanied by the right cheese platter.</p>
                    <p>Come the early Nineteenth Century, the Port drinking games had begun. To truly prove yourself as a man, you first would have to complete the &apos;three bottle challenge&apos;, this is the ability of a young man to finish, in one sitting, three bottles of port.</p>
                    <p>But this crass challenge must have been confined to the watering holes, the taverns, the spat upon lower classes? Such low-grade behaviour would not be seen from the more elite in society until Fresher&apos;s week was invented, surely? Not so. This challenge carried with it a celebrity like badge of honour, so much so that William Pitt the Younger, the brilliant politician would be seen chugging vast amounts of port each day. Pitt was Prime Minister by 24 so who&apos;s to argue with seeing off several bottles of port each day doesn&apos;t improve someone&apos;s prospects.</p>
                    <p>However, as time has gone by and the world yearns for the days when a few bottles of port was a politician&apos;s biggest vice, port has turned into an after-dinner drink, part of a cheese course and a treat on a cold winter&apos;s night. Let us never forget the history of port and its important role in crafting drinking games and politicians. Before it was mandatory you pass the port to the left, you didn&apos;t pass the port until there was none left.</p>
