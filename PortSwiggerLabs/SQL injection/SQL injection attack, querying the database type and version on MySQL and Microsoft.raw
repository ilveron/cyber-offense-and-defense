The Eco Boat is made entirely from paper and reinforced with a super strength adhesive, which will keep you afloat for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes the adhesive will have dissolved due to the high salt content in the ocean, therefore, it is paramount you time your trip to the second. Fifteen minutes each way is more than enough time to enjoy a romantic sunset or to partake of a light supper.
In conjunction with the beach services committee, a number of recycling tubs have been situated in the most popular tourist attractions. After your journey, you will be able to easily fold up the soggy paper and pop it into one of the conveniently positioned receptacles. How many people can say they have enjoyed such a unique experience, and been proactive in saving our beautiful planet at the same time?
Lead the way in leisure activities and join Planet Love today.</td>
